unset GIT_INDEX_FILE
git --work-tree=/var/www/html --git-dir=$HOME/proj/.git checkout -f

In the following line, you need to look closely at the environmental variables that are set each time the post-commit hook is called. In particular, the GIT_INDEX_FILE is set to .git/index.

This path is in relation to the working directory, which in this case is /var/www/html. 
Since the git index does not exist at this location, the script will fail if you leave it as-is. 
To avoid this situation, you can manually unset the variable.

After that, you are just going to 
    use git itself to unpack the newest version of the repository after the commit, into your web directory. 
You will want to force this transaction to make sure this is successful each time.



sudo chown -R `whoami`:`id -gn` /var/www/html
you need to give normal user permission to modify /var/www/html 

What are these
    id
    id -gn
